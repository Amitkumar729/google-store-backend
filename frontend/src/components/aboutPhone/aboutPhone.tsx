                            Designed to comply with dust and water protection rating IP68 under IEC standard 60529 when each device leaves the factory, but the device is not waterproof or dustproof. The accessories are not water- or dust-resistant. Water resistance and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and will diminish or be lost over time due to normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage. Phone is not drop/tumble proof and dropping your device may result in the loss of water/dust resistance. Damage from drops, tumbles and other external forces are not covered under warranty. Liquid damage voids the warranty. See g.co/pixel/water for details.

                            Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Battery testing conducted on a major US carrier network and based on mix of inner and outer screen (for Pixel 9 Pro Fold) in California in mid 2024 (for Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9), early 2024 (for Pixel 9 Pro Fold), and late 2023 (for Pixel 8a) on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Tests began with phones fully charged. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower.
